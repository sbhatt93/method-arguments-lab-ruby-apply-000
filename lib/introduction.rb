#In this first lab, I have defined two methods: #introduction and #introduction_with_language. Both of these methods required arguments and string interpolation which is used in the logic so when the methods are run, #introduction will output a greeting message the users name and #introduction_with_language will output a message which incoroprates the users name and the language they are learning to program. In both instances, the argument requirements have been met.
